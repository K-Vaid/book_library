Local Library is a simple library management system.

Here we have two type of users Borrower and Librarian. The borrowers need to verify email before they are allowed to login. The borrowers can see and find books based on generes, authors or direclty. They can also issue a book and return an alredy issued book. 

The Librarian can see all the issued books and can extend the return period.

Also, this have an review system through which borrowers can review a book and then the review will be evaluated by an pre-trained model which identifies the polarity of the review and tags it as Positive or Negative and stores in the database.

The Librarian can see the pie chart showing total Positive and Negative reviews received on it's dashboard.
